                <h3 class="section-subheading">Overview</h3>

                <p>Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has experienced tremendous growth, transforming from a niche market to a
                    thriving ecosystem that has captured the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and traditional
                    financial institutions. Despite the challenges posed by market volatility and regulatory
                    uncertainties, DeFi has continued to evolve, offering an ever-expanding array of financial services,
                    including decentralized exchanges, yield farming platforms, stablecoins, and innovative
                    derivatives.</p>
                <p>As the DeFi landscape has matured, the need for robust security measures has become increasingly
                    apparent. This workshop aims to bring together leading experts from various domains, including
                    cryptography, game theory, economics, and cybersecurity, to collaboratively explore the current
                    state of DeFi security and chart a path forward. By fostering interdisciplinary dialogue and
                    showcasing cutting-edge research, we seek to identify and address the critical challenges facing
                    DeFi, with a particular focus on safeguarding users from malicious actors and promoting the
                    development of secure, resilient, and user-centric DeFi platforms.</p>
                <p>In addition to the formal presentations and panel discussions, the workshop will provide ample
                    opportunities for attendees to connect, exchange ideas, and forge new collaborations through virtual
                    networking sessions and interactive breakout rooms. By creating a vibrant and inclusive forum for
                    knowledge sharing and innovation, we aim to accelerate the growth of a secure and trustworthy DeFi
                    ecosystem that can drive the next phase of global financial inclusion and empowerment.</p>

                </ul>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Submissions Policy</h3>
                <p>Any link to previously published or concurrently submitted papers by any of the writers must be
                    clearly documented in all submissions, i.e., submissions must be original work. Your submission will
                    be rejected if you fail to define and explain contribution overlaps. It is not allowed to send the
                    same paper to another venue with proceedings or a journal at the same time, as this would result in
                    a desk reject. Please contact the program committee chairs if you have any questions.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Systemization of Knowledge (SoK)</h3>
                <p>Papers on Systemization of Knowledge are welcome. These aren't surveys of previous academic work, but
                    rather a set of findings that have been presented informally by the open-source community or used in
                    operational projects. <b>SoK submissions should have an “SoK:” prefix in the title.</b></p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Anonymous Submission</h3>
                <p>Papers must be provided in a way that allows for anonymous reviews: no author names or affiliations
                    should appear on the title page, and the submission should not disclose the authors' identities in
                    the document. When referring to your prior work, please pretend that prior work is written by
                    someone else. Then blind the references itself if a third-person reference isn't possible (unusual).
                    This policy is not breached if the paper is released as a technical report or in an online archive.
                    If you have any concerns, please contact the program chairs. Papers that are not anonymized
                    correctly should be rejected without its content being reviewed.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Conflict of Interest</h3>
                <p>When submitting a research paper, the submission site will inquire about any possible conflicts of
                    interest between the paper's authors and members of the program committee (PC). According to the
                    following definition, it is the sole duty of all authors of a paper to recognize all possible
                    conflict-of-interest PC participants. When one or more of the following criteria apply, a paper
                    author has a conflict of interest with a PC member:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> The PC member is a co-author of the submitted paper.</li>
                    <li> The PC member was in the last two years in the same company or university as a co-author of the
                        submitted paper.
                    </li>
                    <li> The PC member collaborated with a co-author in the last two years.</li>
                    <li> No matter how long ago, the PC member is or was a co-author's primary thesis advisor.</li>
                    <li> No matter how long ago, a co-author is or was the PC member's primary thesis advisor.</li>
                    <li> The author's PC member is a relative or close personal friend.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Whenever a PC member or co-chair is in conflict with a paper, the PC member or co-chair must not
                    review the paper nor have access to the reviews or discussions. Any other case in which the authors
                    believe they have a dispute or conflict with a PC member, they must proactively explain the reason
                    to the PC chairs, who will mark the conflict if necessary. As of the submission date, papers with
                    incorrect or incomplete conflict of interest details will be automatically refused. When one of the
                    program co-chairs is unable to decide on a paper, the other co-chair would become responsible. When
                    all program co-chairs are in conflict, the paper will be delegated to a neutral committee member.
                    Co-chairs of the program are not permitted to be authors or co-authors on any submission.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Human Subjects and Ethical Considerations</h3>
                <p>Papers that perform human subject studies, evaluate data extracted from human subjects (even
                    anonymized data), or otherwise place humans in danger or affect their financial condition must:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> If appropriate, state whether the study obtained approval or a waiver from each author's
                        institutional ethics review board (IRB).
                    </li>
                    <li> Examine the measures taken to ensure that participants and those who could have been hurt by an
                        experiment were treated ethically and respectfully.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>If the submission reveals novel bugs or vulnerabilities (for example, software flaws in a program or
                    design flaws in a hardware system), the authors must explain the steps they have taken or intend to
                    take to fix these flaws in detail (e.g., by disclosing vulnerabilities to the vendors). If the
                    submission includes personally identifiable information (PII) or other forms of confidential data,
                    the same rules apply. If a paper poses serious ethical or legal issues, it may be rejected.</p>

                <h3 class="section-subheading">Page Limit and Formatting</h3>
                <p>We welcome papers of up to 8 pages, excluding references and bibliographies, in the <a
                        href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">double column ACM CCS format</a>
                    (using the sigconf style). Submissions should be <b>anonymized</b>. Authors of accepted papers must
                    guarantee that one of the authors will register and present the paper at the workshop.</p>
